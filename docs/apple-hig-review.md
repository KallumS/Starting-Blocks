# Review against Apple's Human Interface Guidelines: Foundations

Starting Blocks checked against all 19 Foundations pages (the user's copy,
October 2026), the same review Transient Shuffler had. Writing was done
first, on its own ([0008](decisions/0008-the-window-follows-apples-writing-guidelines.md));
this covers the rest ([0009](decisions/0009-apples-hig-foundations.md)).

The window is drawn by ReaImGui inside REAPER, so some guidance cannot apply:
a script cannot reach VoiceOver, Dynamic Type or Increase Contrast, or read the
system's appearance. Where a guideline is not met for that reason, this says
so rather than counting it as met.

## What changed (2.4)

| Guideline | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Accessibility: the keyboard alone** | Mouse only. | Keyboard navigation is on: Tab and the arrow keys move between controls, Space or Return presses one, and a near-white ring shows where you are. |
| **Accessibility, Typography: larger text** | One fixed size. | **View → Text Size**: 100%, 125%, 150% or 200%, also Cmd+= and Cmd+- (Ctrl on Windows), Cmd+0 for 100%. Remembered between runs. Buttons grow with the text and rows wrap at the window's edge. |
| **Typography: default size** | ReaImGui's own font. | The system's sans-serif at 13 points, the Mac's default text size. |
| **Accessibility: control size and spacing** | Buttons 19 points tall, 8 apart. | 28 points tall (Apple's Mac default) with 12 between them. |
| **Accessibility, Dark Mode: contrast** | Secondary text 4.7:1, warnings 3.4:1. | Every line of text is at least 7:1, the target for small text in a dark window: secondary text `#B0B6C0` (7.4:1), warnings `#FF9E96` (7.6:1). The house red is no longer used for words. |
| **Accessibility, Color: more than colour alone** | A chosen button was shown only by being yellow. | It also has a dark bar under its label. |
| **Layout: nothing important at the bottom of a window** | The message line came last, under Insert, Export and Audition. | It sits at the top, above step 1. |
| **Accessibility: avoid time-boxed elements** | (Messages stayed, but could not be cleared.) | A message stays until **Dismiss**, or a newer one replaces it. |

## Already met

- **Design principles.** The smallest useful piece: three numbered steps in reading order, no dead controls, one setting shown wherever it is asked. Insert is one REAPER undo step and nothing in the project is changed until you insert.
- **Feedback.** Controls change on hover and press; the roll shows the block; the playhead moves while auditioning; Audition turns into Stop.
- **Playback you control.** Nothing plays until Audition is clicked, and Stop ends it; Loop is off until ticked.
- **Colour.** One yellow, for what is on and for the notes, kept apart by ground: the roll is far darker than the chrome (decision 0002).
- **Motion.** Nothing animates except the playhead, which follows playback.
- **Dark Mode.** Always dark. Apple allows this for apps built around media,
  and advises against an app-only appearance setting; it is also the house
  scheme.
- **Writing.** Decision 0008.
- **Privacy.** Nothing is collected or sent. Only preferences are saved, in REAPER's own settings; an exported .mid goes where REAPER's resource folder is.
- **Inclusion.** Plain musical words; the tooltips explain each choice.

## Not met, because a ReaImGui script can't

- **VoiceOver, Voice Control and Switch Control** cannot read a ReaImGui
  window.
- **Dynamic Type and Increase Contrast** cannot be read from a script. Text
  Size and the 7:1 colours stand in for them.
- **Right to left.** The window is English only; time runs left to right, as in
  every DAW.

## Not relevant

Materials (Liquid Glass), app icons, icons and SF Symbols, images, spatial
layout and immersive experiences: the window has none of these.

## Unverified in REAPER

- Whether REAPER hands Cmd+=, Cmd+- and Cmd+0 to the window (the View menu
  does the same either way).
- Which face "sans-serif" gives on each system (Helvetica or San Francisco on
  a Mac, Segoe UI or Arial on Windows).

## Checked by

`tests/test_ui.lua` with `tests/hig_mock.lua` (the family's shared checks): keyboard navigation on and its ring not the accent; 13-point text, 28-point controls, 12 points apart; every line of text 7:1 on the ground and every button's ink 7:1 on its fill; a bar on every chosen button; the warning above everything else, still there twenty frames later, gone on Dismiss; the View menu's sizes, the keys, every button wide enough for its label at 200%, the size saved under its own key, clamped and restored. Each was broken on purpose and the suite failed - except a button narrower than its label, which no label here can be: every fixed width already holds its label at every size.
